(defn main! ()
  ; This is dumb but it makes us produce a binary
  (print! "")

  ; We should be able to call through a thunk as well
  ((black-box! print!) "")

  ; And through a callback
  (map print! '(""))

  ; And print an unknown value
  (print! (black-box! ""))

  ; And do both at once
  ((black-box! print!) (black-box! "")))
